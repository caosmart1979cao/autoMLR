# autoMLR: Your Automated Machine Learning Assistant

`autoMLR` is an R package designed to streamline the process of machine learning model tuning. It provides a robust, configuration-driven workflow to automatically select, tune, and train models, inspired by best practices in data science.

## Core Features

  * **Model-Agnostic Workflow**: Easily switch between a curated list of powerful machine learning models by changing a single variable.
  * **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Leverages `mlr3` for robust, automated tuning using random search and cross-validation.
  * **Reproducible Science**: From setting seeds to generating final reports, every step is designed for reproducibility.
  * **Insightful Visualizations**: Automatically generate plots to understand hyperparameter importance and performance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `autoMLR` from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("caosmart1979cao/autoMLR")
```
